## What is this?

This is a framework related to Probabilitic Robotics. 

All modules are literally the exercises of the course the course "Introduction to Mobile Robotics - Autonomous Mobile Systems" provided by Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. See details in http://ais.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ss19/robotics/

Language: python.

Dependencies: 
  * matplotlib
  * numpy

So far these topics listed below are implemented in this repository:
  * odometry based motion model
  * sensor model
  * discrete Bayes filter
  * particle filter
  * extended Kalman filter
  * occupancy grid mapping
  * FastSLAM
